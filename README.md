# iOS-Architecture

The guide covers how I architect my iOS apps. These are not best practices, and some of it is probably plain bad. If you see something that could be improved, please submit an issue.


Most of my design choices are inspired by this blog post from Dave DeLong: [A Better MVC](https://davedelong.com/blog/2017/11/06/a-better-mvc-part-1-the-problems/). If you haven't read it yet, I suggest you do.
